# OOPS (Object-Oriented Programming System)

- The basic goal of OOPs concepts with real time examples is to connect data and the functions that operate on it so that no other part of the code may access it except that function.


- In object-oriented programming, a group of data properties is combined with functions or methods to form an “object.” OOP languages are often class-based, which implies that a class defines the data characteristics and functions that are used to create objects, which are instances of the class.


- Object-oriented programming generally referred to as OOPS is the backbone of java as java is not a purely object oriented language but it is object oriented language.


- Object oriented programming brings data and its behaviour together in a single entity called objects. Object oriented programming brings data and its behaviour together in a single entity called objects.


- Example: Consider the Automobile Class. There may be many automobiles with different names and brands, but they will all have some basic characteristics, such as four wheels, a speed limit, and a range of mileage. The class is Car, and the attributes are wheels, speed limitations, and mileage.


- Instead of writing a program, you create classes with OOP. Data and functions are both contained in a class. You construct an object, which is an instance of that class, when you want to save something in memory. As an example, you can create a Customer class that contains customer-related data and functions. You must then build a new Customer class object if you want your program to generate a customer in memory.


- It simplifies software development and maintenance by providing some concepts:

1. Object
2. Class
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism
5. Abstraction
6. Encapsulation

- Apart from these concepts, there are some other terms which are used in Object-Oriented design:

1. Coupling
2. Cohesion
3. Association
4. Aggregation
5. Composition

## Difference between Association & Coupling

- Coupling refers to the extent of knowledge one class knows about another class, or it refers to the degree of direct knowledge that one element has of another.

- Association is a relation between two separate classes which establishes through their Objects.
