# Interface

    
- Interface is not a class. It is an design or blue print to implement those methods.

- Interface consists of method which all are by default public abstract methods.

- To implement interface we need to use keyword 'implements'.

- If all the methods of interface are not implemented in the class , that class becomes abstract.

- All variables inside interface are by default final & static.

## Types of interfaces

1. Normal Interface - one interface multiple methods

2. Functional/Single Abstract method Interface - one interface and only one method (Lambda expression)

3. Marker Interface - One interface and no methods. Blank interface. Its used in serialization / deserialization. 
                        E.g Resuming a game , so we will require its previous objects.
