# What is JAVA?

- Java is a widely used object-oriented programming language and software platform that runs on billions of devices, including notebook computers, mobile devices, gaming consoles, medical devices and many others.

- Java is a technology consisting of both a programming language and a software platform. To create an application using Java, you need to download the Java Development Kit (JDK).

- You write the program in the Java programming language, then a compiler turns the program into Java bytecode—the instruction set for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that is a part of the Java runtime environment (JRE). Java bytecode runs without modification on any system that supports JVMs, allowing your Java code to be run anywhere.

# JVM,JRE and JDK

1. JDK (Java Development Kit) is a Kit that provides the environment to develop and execute(run) the Java program. JDK is a kit(or package) that includes two things

 - Development Tools(to provide an environment to develop your java programs)

- JRE (to execute your java program).

2. JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is an installation package that provides an environment to only run(not develop) the java program(or application)onto your machine. JRE is only used by those who only want to run Java programs that are end-users of your system.

3. JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is a very important part of both JDK and JRE because it is contained or inbuilt in both. Whatever Java program you run using JRE or JDK goes into JVM and JVM is responsible for executing the java program line by line, hence it is also known as an interpreter.

## JRE

The components of JRE are as follows:

1. **Deployment technologies**, including deployment, Java Web Start, and Java Plug-in.

2. **User interface toolkits**, including Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT), Swing, Java 2D, Accessibility, Image I/O, Print Service, Sound, drag, and drop (DnD), and input methods.

3. **Integration libraries**, including Interface Definition Language (IDL), Java Database Connectivity (JDBC), Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI), Remote Method Invocation (RMI), Remote Method Invocation Over Internet Inter-Orb Protocol (RMI-IIOP), and scripting.

4. **Other base libraries**, including international support, input/output (I/O), extension mechanism, Beans, Java Management Extensions (JMX), Java Native Interface (JNI), Math, Networking, Override Mechanism, Security, Serialization, and Java for XML Processing (XML JAXP).

5. **Lang and util base libraries**, including lang and util, management, versioning, zip, instrument, reflection, Collections, Concurrency Utilities, Java Archive (JAR), Logging, Preferences API, Ref Objects, and Regular Expressions.

6. **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**, including Java HotSpot Client and Server Virtual Machines.

- JVM(Java Virtual Machine) acts as a run-time engine to run Java applications. JVM is the one that actually calls the main method present in a java code. JVM is a part of JRE(Java Runtime Environment).

- Java applications are called WORA (Write Once Run Anywhere). This means a programmer can develop Java code on one system and can expect it to run on any other Java-enabled system without any adjustments. This is all possible because of JVM.

- When we compile a .java file, .class files(contains byte-code) with the same class names present in .java file are generated by the Java compiler. This .class file goes into various steps when we run it. These steps together describe the whole JVM.

- Consider a java source file saved as ‘Example.java’. The file is compiled into a set of Byte Code that is stored in a “.class” file. Here it will be “Example.class“. 

## javac

- The javac is the primary Java compiler included in the Java Development Kit (JDK). It converts the java source code into byte code.

- Javac is the standard Java compiler and part of the Java Development Kit. It creates bytecode for the Java virtual machine from valid Java code.

# JSHELL

- **jshell** provides a way to interactively evaluate declarations, statements, and expressions of the Java programming language, making it easier to learn the language, explore unfamiliar code and APIs, and prototype complex code. Java statements, variable definitions, method definitions, class definitions, import statements, and expressions are accepted. The bits of code entered are called snippets.

- Enter into JSHELL `jshell [options] [load-files]`
