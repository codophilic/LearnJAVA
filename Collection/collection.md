# Collection

-  Any group of individual objects which are represented as a single unit is known as the collection of the objects.
 
- The Collection interface (java.util.Collection) and Map interface (java.util.Map) are the two main “root” interfaces of Java collection classes.

- The Collection in Java is a framework that provides an architecture to store and manipulate the group of objects.

- Java Collections can achieve all the operations that you perform on a data such as searching, sorting, insertion, manipulation, and deletion.

- Java Collection means a single unit of objects. Java Collection framework provides many interfaces (Set, List, Queue, Deque) and classes (ArrayList, Vector, LinkedList, PriorityQueue, HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet).

- In collection the elements are denoted as E.
 
## What is a framework in Java?

- It provides readymade architecture.

- It represents a set of classes and interfaces.

## What is Collection framework?

- The Collection framework represents a unified architecture for storing and manipulating a group of objects. 

- It has Interfaces and its implementations, i.e., classes,Algorithm

- Collection is a interface so there are already in-build classes which has implemented its method.
